Experimental features are implemented to iterate on new functionality. Experimental features have limited test coverage and the functionality may change in future versions of the CMSIS-Toolbox without further notice.

The CMSIS-Toolbox 2.7 implements the following experimental features:

## Resource Management

In a multi-processor or multi-project application the `target type` describes the target hardware. A solution is a collection of related projects and the context-set defines the projects that are deployed to the target hardware. A project uses a subset of resources (called regions at linker level).

The [linker script management](build-overview.md#linker-script-management) is extended for multi-processor or multi-project applications with the following features:

- When [`resources:`](#resources) node is specified in one of the `*.cproject.yml` or `*.clayer.yml` files of a *csolution project*:
  - The file `.\cmsis\<solution-name>+<target-name>.regions.h` is generated. This file contains the global region settings of a solution for one target-type.
  - The file `.\cmsis\<solution-name>+<target-name>.regions.h` replaces the `regions_<device_or_board>.h` that is  located in the directory `./RTE/Device/<device>`. The `regions_<device_or_board>.h` is longer generated.

- A `define: <project-name>_cproject` is always added to the linker script pre-processor (also when no `resources:` node is used).

The following picture explains the extended linker script management for multi-project applications.

### `resources:`

The `resources:` node specifies the resources required by a project. It is used at the level of `project:`, `setup:`, or `layer:`. The `resources:` node is additive; when multiple `resources:` nodes specify the same region the size is added.

> **Note:**
> 
> In a next iteration, the linker script may be generated by the CMSIS-Toolbox and [features from uVision to allocate source modules to specific regions](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101407/0541/Creating-Applications/Tips-and-Tricks/File-and-Group-Specific-Options) may get added.
> Therefore the `resources:` node is forward looking in the way heap and stack is specified.

```yml
  resources:
    regions:
      - region: __ROM0    # region name pre-defined in script template: __ROM0..3
        size: 0x10000     # specifies region size
#       name: ITCM_Flash  - maps to physical memory name(s), if missing use PDSC default memory
#       address:          - absolution address of region; not in scope for 2.7
#       startup:          - locate startup/vectors to this region; not in scope for 2.7
#       align:            - alignment restrictions of the regions; not in scope for 2.7

      - region: __RAM0    # region name pre-defined in script template: __RAM0..3
        size:  0x8000     # specifies region size
        heap:  0x2000     # heap size (only permitted region __RAM0)
        stack: 0x4000     # stack size (only permitted in region __RAM0)
#       name:             - maps to physical memory name(s), if missing use PDSC default memory
#         - SRAM1
#         - SRAM2
#       address:          - absolution address of region; not in scope for 2.7
#       align:            - alignment restrictions of the regions; not in scope for 2.7
#       sections:         - potentially locate sections (requires linker script generation); not in scope for 2.7
#         - .text.function
```

### Question

- Should the `<solution-name>+<target-name>.regions.h` file contain also `#define's` for the overall avaiable memory, i.e. for a boot loader?

## Adding Memory

Hardware targets may have additional off-chip memory. A `memory:` node that can be added as additional information to a target type as shown below:

```yml
solution:
  :
  target-types:
    - type: MyHardware
      device: STMicroelectronics::STM32F746NGHx
      memory:                                  # Additional memory available in MyHardware
        - name: Ext-Flash                      # Identifier
        - access: rx                           # access permission 
        - start: 0x40000000        
        - size: 0x200000
        - algorithm: Flash/Ext-Flash.flm       # Programming algorithm
```

## Run and Debug Management

The CMSIS-Pack PDSC files contain information about device/board parameters and software components:

- [Flash algorithms](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/Open-CMSIS-Pack-Spec/main/html/flashAlgorithm.html) of device memory (in DFP) and board memory (in BSP).
- On-board debug adapter (a default programming/debug channel) including features.
- Available memory of device and board.
- Device parameters such as processor core(s) and clock speed.
- [Debug Access Sequences](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/Open-CMSIS-Pack-Spec/main/html/debug_description.html) and [System Description Files](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/Open-CMSIS-Pack-Spec/main/html/sdf_pg.html) that support more complex Cortex-A/R/M configurations.
- [CMSIS-SVD System View Description (SVD)](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/svd-spec/main/index.html) files for viewing device peripherals.
- [CMSIS-View Software Component Viewer Description (SCVD)](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS-View/latest/SCVD_Format.html) files for analysis of software components (RTOS, Middleware).

The CMSIS-Toolbox build system manages device/board/software components, controls the build output (typically ELF/DWARF files), and has provisions for HEX, BIN and post-processing. It allows to manage different [target-types](build-overview.md#project-setup-for-multiple-targets-and-builds) and the [context set](build-overview.md#working-with-context-set)  manages the images that belong to a target.

In addition the user may need the following information which should be added to the YML-Input files for the CMSIS-Toolbox.

- Flash algorithms for external memory in custom hardware (see [Adding Memory](#adding-memory)).
- ToDo: Additional images that should be loaded.
- ToDo: Device configuration information.
- ToDo: Access information for protected debug ports (i.e. encryption keys).

### `<solution-name>+<target-name>.cbuild-run.yml`

The `<solution-name>+<target-name>.cbuild-run.yml` is generated in the folder `.cmsis` and provides the relevant information for executing Run and Debug commands. Overall it:

- simplifies the usage of flash programmers and debuggers.
- provides information for command line and IDE workflows in a consistent way.
- ensures that information is portable, i.e from a cloud-hosted CI system to a desktop test system.

The `<solution-name>+<target-name>.cbuild-run.yml` file provides access to PDSC information and the build output of one target. It also exports the [Debug Access Sequences](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/Open-CMSIS-Pack-Spec/main/html/debug_description.html).

![Run and Debug Information Management](./images/cbuild-run.png "Run and Debug Information Management")

The `<solution-name>+<target-name>.cbuild-run.yml` file represents a context-set of a solution.

**Content of `<solution-name>+<target-name>.cbuild-run.yml`:**

### Usage

The `*.cbuild-run.yml` file can be directly passed to programmers and debug tools, for example using a command line option. It contains all information that needs to be passed.

```bash
>programmer -csolution MySolution+MyHardware.cbuild-run.yml
```

### Questions

- What should be done now to simplify above information while making it more future proof?

For CMSIS-Toolbox 3.0:

- Should the location of cbuild information files change to folder `.\.cmsis`?
- Should the structure of build information file change and include `cbuild-run.yml`? The cbuild information file will then represent a context-set, and not just one context.
