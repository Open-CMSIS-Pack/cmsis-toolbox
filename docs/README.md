# CMSIS-Toolbox

Thank you for using the **CMSIS-Toolbox** that provides command-line tools for:

- Project creation and build of embedded applications utilizing [Software Packs](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/) with support for multiple compilation tools.
- Software Pack creation, maintenance, and distribution utilizing the [CMSIS-Pack format](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/Open-CMSIS-Pack-Spec/main/html/index.html).

## Manual Chapters

- [**Overview**](#content-of-overview-chapter) of the CMSIS-Toolbox (this chapter) and explanations of the other manual chapters.

- [**Installation**](installation.md): explains the setup of the CMSIS-Toolbox along with a build environment for embedded applications that are based on Arm Cortex-M processors.

- [**Build Overview**](build-overview.md): describes the overall concept, outlines the *user input files* that describes the software application, and contains references to examples and project templates.

- [**Build Tools**](build-tools.md): command line descriptions for `cbuild` (build projects), `csolution` (transform *User Input Files*), and `cpackget` (manage software packs).

- [**Project File Format**](YML-Input-Format.md): detailed description of the *user input files* that describes the software application in YAML format.

- [**Build Information Files**](YML-CBuild-Format.md): details about the build information generated by the `csolution` tool.

- [**Build Operation**](build-operation.md): contains for advanced users further details about build process, CMake backend configuration, and generator integration.

- [**Pack Creation**](pack-tools.md): describes how to create software packs and explains the pack creation tools `packchk` (software pack verification) and `svdconv` (SVD file converter).

## Target Audience

This user's guide assumes some top-level knowledge about Cortex-M software development. It is written for embedded developers that want to utilize microcontroller devices that incorporate Cortex-M processors, Ethos-U NPUs, and work with C/C++ compiler toolchains. The CMSIS-Toolbox supports currently:

- [Arm Compiler for Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded) version 6.18 or higher
- [Arm GNU Toolchain (GCC)](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain) version 10.3.1 or higher
- [IAR Compiler](https://www.iar.com/products/architectures/arm/) version 9.32.1 or higher
- [CLANG Compiler version 17.0.1](https://github.com/ARM-software/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm/releases) or higher based on LLVM technology

## Overall Workflow

The CMSIS-Toolbox uses Software Packs for device/board support and access reusable software components.  The operation is controlled via intuitive [User Input files in YAML format](YML-Input-Format.md). The overall application is defined in the `*.csolution.yml` file and contains one or more projects that can utilize pre-configured software layers. The build engine CMake/Ninja calls the C/C++ compiler toolchain that generates the Build Output.

The [**cbuild: Build Invocation**](build-tools.md#cbuild-invocation) command orchestrates the overall build steps. This command calls individual command line tools to generate the application as outlined in the following diagram.

The build steps are:

1. [**cpackget**](build-tools.md#cpackget-invocation) downloads Software Packs that are required for `*.csolution.yml` when using the option `--pack`.
2. [**csolution**](build-tools.md#csolution-invocation) processes the User Input and the Software Packs to generate the overall Build Information. Refer to [Overview of Operation](build-overview.md#overview-of-operation) for details.
3. **buildmgr** converts this Build Information into CMake format.
4. **CMake/Ninja** call the C/C++ compiler toolchain to translate the source files into the application image.

## Command Line and IDE Usage

The CMSIS-Toolbox is a set of command line tools that is designed for stand-alone usage and integration into IDEs or DevOps (for CI workflows).

## Benefits

The overall benefits of the CMSIS-Toolbox are:

- Flexible CLI tools that can be used stand-alone or integrated into [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) or DevOps systems for Continuous Integration (CI).
- Stand-alone tools are available [for all host platforms](https://artifacts.keil.arm.com/cmsis-toolbox/) (Windows, Mac, Linux) for flexible deployment.
- [Software Packs](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/) simplify tool setup with `device:` or `board:` selection and project creation with access to reusable software components.
- Organize solutions with projects that are independently managed simplifies a wide range of use cases including  multi-processor applications or unit testing.
- Integrates with domain specific [generators](build-overview.md#use-a-generator) (i.e. CubeMX) that simplify configuration of devices/boards and complex software stacks such as motor control.
- Provisions for product lifecycle management (PLM) with versioned software packs that are easy to update and management for configuration files.
- Software layers enable code reuse across similar applications with a pre-configured set of source files and software components.
- Target types allow application deployment to different hardware (test board, production hardware, virtual hardware, etc.).
- Build types support software testing and verification (debug build, test build, release build, ect.).
- Support for multiple toolchains, even within the same set of *project files* and command line options to select different toolchains during verification.
- [Linker Script Management](build-overview.md#linker-script-management) utilizes device and board information to define the  available memory and allows flexible control of the linker operation.
- Uses a CMake backend for the build process that integrates with other tools such as VS Code intellisense.
