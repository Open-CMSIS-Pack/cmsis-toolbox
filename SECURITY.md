## Reporting a Security Issue  

The Open-CMSIS-Pack cmsis-toolbox maintainers take security issues seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure. Your efforts to improve project security are highly valued.  

We use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). To submit a report, please include:  

- A detailed description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability  
- Affected project versions  
- Any known mitigations  

A maintainer will acknowledge your report as soon as possible and guide the next steps. We will keep you informed of progress toward a fix and may request additional details if needed.  

## Vulnerability Management  

Once a security issue is reported, the maintainers will:  

1. Confirm the issue  
2. Identify/Confirm affected versions  
3. Audit related code for similar vulnerabilities  
4. Develop and release patches for maintained versions  

## Improving This Policy  

If you have suggestions for improving this process, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
