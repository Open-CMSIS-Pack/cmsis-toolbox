## Reporting a Security Issue

The Open-CMSIS-Pack cmsis-toolbox maintainers take security issues seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure. Your efforts to improve project security are highly valued.

We use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) guidelines.

- A detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Affected project versions
- Any known mitigations

A maintainer will acknowledge your report as soon as possible and guide the next steps. We will keep you informed of progress toward a fix and may request additional details if needed.

## Vulnerability Management

Once a security issue is reported, the maintainers will:

1. Confirm the issue
2. Identify/Confirm affected versions
3. Audit related code for similar vulnerabilities
4. Develop and release patches for maintained versions
